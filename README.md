# hyphy-vision-components

This repo is a WIP, all that follows should be considered subject to change.

The idea for this so far is that it may serve as a place where visualization components for hyphy-vision can be built and tested.
It has additionally grown to become home to some basic statistics and utility functions that those components are likely to rely on.
There are also various demo pages for individual components (to help ensure they work properly) and demo pages for results summaries for
any HyPhy methods that have existing Observable Notebooks already in production (to help ensure we port them over properly).
Eventually, I would hope people might be willing to develop prototypes for new results summaries here rather than in Notebook.
However, if someone is particularly attached to Notebook, thats ok! We can convert them as needed. Importantly, though, I do NOT currently
expect demo pages for results summaries to go directly from here to production. These are for prototyping and component QC purposes.
Components and their dependencies will be available as an npm package, which can be used in production. If we want to put markdown pages
from here into production that will require some additional thinking/ planning/ development.

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) app. To install the required dependencies, run:

```
npm install
```

Then, to start the local preview server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your app.

## Project structure

A typical Framework project looks like this:

```ini
.
├─ src
│  ├─ components
│  │  └─ timeline.js           # an importable module
│  ├─ data
│  │  ├─ launches.csv.js       # a data loader
│  │  └─ events.json           # a static data file
│  ├─ example-dashboard.md     # a page
│  ├─ example-report.md        # another page
│  └─ index.md                 # the home page
├─ .gitignore
├─ observablehq.config.js      # the app config file
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

**`src`** - This is the “source root” — where your source files live. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/project-structure#routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`src/index.md`** - This is the home page for your app. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`src/data`** - You can put [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/data-loaders) or static data files anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here.

**`src/components`** - You can put shared [JavaScript modules](https://observablehq.com/framework/imports) anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here. This helps you pull code out of Markdown files and into JavaScript modules, making it easier to reuse code across pages, write tests and run linters, and even share code with vanilla web applications.

**`observablehq.config.js`** - This is the [app configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the app’s title.
