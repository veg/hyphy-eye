# Welcome to hyphy-eye

hyphy-eye is an interactive ObservableHQ framework for visualizing results from HyPhy analyses and prototyping new data visualizations for Datamonkey.org. It provides:

- **Legacy Notebooks** for each HyPhy method: aBSREL, BUSTED, FEL, MEME, GARD, NRM (non-reversible model), and MULTI-HIT you can upload your own HyPhy results JSON files to these notebooks to generate plots and tables.
- **Visualization Components** which can be shared across the various methods and used to generate plots and tables from HyPhy results JSON.
- A **Visualization Registry** to generate, preview, and test individual visualization modules using the components developed here.

The components, registry and all supporting utilities are available as an npm package at [hyphy-eye](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyphy-eye).
